          The constant flooding in the land of Mesopotamia caused the crops that
          they grown to be destroyed so they have to find a solution. Good thing
          they found a quick solution they made decided to irrigate the water
          with canals which become the roadways of the land. They also built
          dikes to prevent the flooding into the crops. This way, they quickly
          grew crops. Over the growth of the text they got a lot of population,
          the Mesopotamia's became super popular they had to constantly get
          food. Which demanded more water. Over the years, the irrigation system
          was later found to be a flaw, because of the water that constantly
          shipped the salt, which ended up destroying all the crops, so now they
          either have to move to a different area or they have to die. There way
          of farming is one of the best if it wasn't for the salt. Because of
          th4re location it is really hard for them to control the water,
          especially the tight overflow and excessive water causing salt. There
          irrigation system has been reworked more then once and has been
          further improved. But at the end there is still flaws about the
          irrigation system and failed which making the Ancient Mesopotamia's
          civilization ended. According to the British Museum, early
          Mesopotamian farmersâ€™ main crops were barley and wheat. But they also
          created gardens shaded by date palms, where they cultivated a wide
          variety of crops including beans, peas, lentils, cucumbers, leeks,
          lettuce and garlic, as well as fruit such as grapes, apples, melons
          and figs. They also milked sheep, goats and cows to make butter, and
          slaughtered them for meat. Eventually, the agricultural revolution in
          Mesopotamia led to what Diamond describes as the next big step in
          progress, the Urban Revolution. Roughly 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in
          Sumer, villages evolved into cities. One of the earliest and most
          prominent was Uruk, a walled community with 40,000 to 50,000
          inhabitants. Others included Eridu, Bad-tibira, Sippar, and Shuruppak,
          according to the Ancient History Encyclopedia. The Sumerians developed
          may have been the earliest system of writing as well as sophisticated
          art, architecture, and complex government bureaucracies to supervise
          agriculture, commerce and religious activity. Sumer also became a
          hotbed of innovation, as the Sumerians took inventions that other
          ancient peoples developed, from pottery to textile weaving, and
          figured out how to do them on an industrial scale. Meanwhile, Upper
          Mesopotamia developed its own urban areas such as Tepe Gawra, where
          researchers have discovered brick temples with intricate recesses and
          pilasters, and found other evidence of a sophisticated culture.

          <h5>Agriculture</h5>
        </div>
        <p className="content t">
          Agriculture is the ratio main economic activity in ancient
          Mesopotamia. Operating under harsh constraints, notably the arid
          <img src={require("./agr.jpg")} />
          climate, the Mesopotamian farmers developed effective strategies that
          enabled them to support the development of the first states, the first
          cities, and then the first known empires, under the supervision of the
          institutions which dominated the economy: the royal and provincial
          palaces, the temples, and the domains of the elites. They focused
          above all on the cultivation of cereals (particularly barley) and
          sheep farming, but also farmed legumes, as well as date palms in the
          south and grapes in the north. In reality, there were two types of
          Mesopotamian agriculture, corresponding to the two main ecological
          domains, which largely overlapped with cultural distinctions. The
          agriculture of southern or Lower Mesopotamia, the land of Sumer and
          Akkad, which later became Babylonia received almost no rain and
          required large scale irrigation works which were supervised by temple
          estates, but could produce high returns. The agriculture of Northern
          or Upper Mesopotamia, the land that would eventually become Assyria,
          had enough rainfall to allow dry agriculture most of the time so that
          irrigation and large institutional estates were less important, but
          the returns were also usually lower. They also invented the plow and
          with the help of the ox they can increase there farming speed by alot.

          Because of the large amount of water constantly flooding
          <img src={require("./irragation.jpg")} />
          in they have to use irrigation to manage the water to The first ever
          signs of this was back arond in 6000 BC at Choga Mami which is a place
          in the center of Mesopotmia. During this time they decided to use
          irrigation as a way to control water and also make better changes to
          the farms. This not only brought a lot of food, this also allowed
          water to go to places which became the rail road of Acient
          Mesopotmaia. The railroad allowed the Kanels to travel faster and was
          a really good rail road.

        <p className="content t">
          The flaw inside the acient mesopotamia farming is quite big. First the
          <img src={require("./fail.jpg")} />
          irrigation system has many flaws, because of the water it causes the
          land to grow salt causing the crops to die out. The incease of food
          also lead to more and more peopel to come here which also meant that
          the food resourse are more and more demanding. With this the farmers
          have to plow and seed the farm alot leading to another flaw in the
          system. The water can get inside more and with that causes more salt
          and then the crops all die out. This is how the Acient Mesopotmia
          ended.
